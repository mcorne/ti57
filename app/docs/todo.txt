- fix EN manual
- fix 1.05EE01 that returns invalid token (<string>, line 28) because it translates into x = 01
- fix 1.5EE1 STO 0 that stores 1 in mem0 instead of 15, 1.5EE1= STO 0 works though
- add seed in introduction
- fix return before label in subroutine, add try/catch, raise UserWarning('INV SBR')
- fix NUMBER for mem/fix from 0 to 7 vs gto from 0 to 9, currently limited to 7
