- fix EN manual
- fix 1.05EE01 that returns invalid token (<string>, line 28) because it translates into x = 01
- fix 1.5EE1 STO 0 that stores 1 in mem0 instead of 15, 1.5EE1= STO 0 works though
- fix pattern to allow STO6 for STO 6
- cache generated files, cache jinja files with flask-caching
- display edit instead of highlight button when site is run after navigator is restarted (and there is no cookie)
