- fix EN manual
- fix 1.05EE01 that returns invalid token (<string>, line 28) because it translates into x = 01
- fix 1.5EE1 STO 0 that stores 1 in mem0 instead of 15, 1.5EE1= STO 0 works though
- fix in hi-lo exception on return before label in subroutine:
  in instruction set: change INV SBR to goto.end, add label.end at the end
  add post treatment to replace goto.end with return and remove label.end if no return before a label
- fix NUMBER for mem/fix from 0 to 7 vs gto from 0 to 9 currently limited to 7
- fix negative number in input data, ex. -1 -> 1 +/-
- display number of steps, total and for input data, entry point, subroutine
- fix pattern to allow STO6 for STO 6
- fix seed as it cannot be done after a test since you need 7 steps for .123456
