- fix EN manual
- fix 1.05EE01 that returns invalid token (<string>, line 28) because it translates into x = 01
- fix 1.5EE1 STO 0 that stores 1 in mem0 instead of 15, 1.5EE1= STO 0 works though
- fix in hi-lo exception on return before label in subroutine:
  in instruction set: change INV SBR to goto.end, add label.end at the end
  add post treatment to replace goto.end with return and remove label.end if no return before a label
- fix NUMBER for mem/fix from 0 to 7 vs gto from 0 to 9 currently limited to 7
- fix negative number in input data, ex. -1 -> 1 +/-
- add list of keys, in program tooltip (?), or maybe only the keys not obvious to type ex. x^2, V2, and also / *
- enforce optionally the 50 steps limit
- fix pattern to allow STO6 for STO 6

- handle TI-57 II,  include ti codes that have changed
