- allow array of code lines in token.php, and remove unnecessary actions
- use generic token as keys, eg "exp" instead of "INV 2nd ln" so it can be mapped easily for other calculators
- handle memory, goto, label as a pattern to capture any number, eg "STO [0-7]"
- shift statements group to the right 4 spaces
- use "statement" instead of "code_line", "group" instead of "code_lines", "script" instead of "code"
- add a covariance token, covariance = q = (sum(X*Y) - sum(X) * sum(Y) / n) / n
  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Covariance
- handle RST

- review/fix application css and js
- import time, math, goto (https://pypi.org/project/goto-statement/) along with internal functions
