# Same Birthday

# What is the probability that two or more people have the same birthday in a group of five?
# Answer: 2.7% chance in a group of 5 people and 56.9% in a group of 25.
# Tip! This is actually 1 minus the probability that no one has the same birthday.
# For example: 1 - 364/365 X 363/365 X 362/365 X 361/365 for a group of 5 people.
