# Introduction to programming the TI-57 (Dice Roll)

# The TI-57 Programmable Calculator was made by Texas Instruments around 1980.
# It has a LED Display, 50 Program steps and 8 memory registers.
# A TI-57 Program is a set of basic instructions that can perform calculations,
# read or write memory, test a value, go to a program step to make a loop or call a subroutine.
# The TI-57 Program Emulator (this web site) translates the instructions into Python then runs it.
# The Python code can be checked below along with the Calculator Internal State.

# The following program generates a random number (R) from 2 to 12 to simulate two dice rolls.
# Here is the algorithm: R = Int(A X 6 + 1) where A = Fract[(π + A)^8] and A = 0 to start.

# Run the Program to roll the dice then check the details in the History.

# Data Input

# Data Processing (25 steps)
0 STO 1             # Reset the total
2nd Lbl 1
2nd pi + RCL 2 =    # i = π + A
y^x 8 = INV 2nd Int # A = Fract[i^8]
STO 2
X 6 + 1 = 2nd Int   # R = Int(A X 6 + 1)
2nd Pause           # Keep track of the number
SUM 1               # Update the total
2nd DSZ             # Dice left to roll?
GTO 1               # Yes, roll the next dice
RCL 1               # No, display the total
