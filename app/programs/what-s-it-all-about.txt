# What's it all about? (Dice Roll)

# The TI-57 is a programmable pocket calculator made by Texas Instruments around 1980.
# It has a LED display, 50 program steps and 8 memory registers.
# A TI-57 program is a set of basic instructions that can perform calculations,
# read or write memory, test a value, go to a specific location, make a loop or call a subroutine.
# The TI-57 emulator (this web site) translates the instructions into Python then runs it.
# As an example, the following program generates a random number to simulate a dice roll.
