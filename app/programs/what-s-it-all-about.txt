# What's it all about? (Dice Roll)

# The TI-57 is a programmable pocket calculator made by Texas Instruments around 1980.
# It has a LED display, 50 program steps and 8 memory registers.
# A TI-57 program is a set of basic instructions that can perform calculations,
# read or write memory, test a value, go to a program step to make a loop or call a subroutine.
# The TI-57 program emulator (this web site) translates the instructions into Python then runs it.
# The Python code can be checked below along with the calculator internal state.
# As an example, this program generates a random number (r) from 1 to 6 to simulate a dice roll.
# It implements the following algorithm:
# i = (π + a)^8 where a = 0 the first time
# a = i - Int(i) to calculate Fract(i)
# r = Int(a X 6 + 1)
