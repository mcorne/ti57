# Cannon Shot (On Target)

# Select the target distance, choose an angle of elevation then fire!
# The calculator displays a positive or negative distance if you overshoot or undershoot.
# It displays 9.9999999 if you score a hit within 100 m of the target.
# So, what is the angle to hit a target 20 000 m away?
# Answer: 15Â°.
