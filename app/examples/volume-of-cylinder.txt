# Volume of a cylinder

# Calculate the volume: π x radius² x height
# We'll have for example a volume of  of 314.16 for a diameterof 10 and a height of 4.

# Input
10 STO 1 # Enter diameter
4  STO 2 # Enter height

# Main program
2nd Fix 2
RCL 1 / 2 = # Radius =  diameter / 2
x2 X 2nd pi # Area = π x radius²
X RCL 2 =   # Volume = area X height
R/S
