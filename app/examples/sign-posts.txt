# What is the area of a square and the volume of a cube for a given side?
# What is the area of a circle and the volume of a sphere for a given radius?
# For example, we'll have respectively 38.07 and 234.89 for a side of 6.17, and 27.9 and 110.85 for a radius of 2.98.
# Write and call four subroutines, one for each calculation.
# Note that the pauses are simulated by storing intermediate results in registers.
