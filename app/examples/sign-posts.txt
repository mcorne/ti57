# Calculate the area of a square: side².
# Calculate the volume of a cube: side³.
# Calculate the area of a circle: π x radius².
# Calculate the volume of a sphere: 4/3π x radius³.
# For example, we'll have respectively 38.07, 234.89 for a side of 6.17, and 27.9, 110.85 and a radius of 2.98.
# Note that each pause is simulated by storing each intermediate result in a register.
