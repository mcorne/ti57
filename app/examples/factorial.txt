# Input
5 STO 0     # Number

# Main program
RCL 0 X
2nd Lbl 1
INV 2nd Dsz # Decrease the number and test ?
GTO 2       # If zero, go finish the multiplication
RCL 0 X     # If not zero, multiply with the number
GTO 1
2nd Lbl 2
1 =

# Note that the following code is more efficient but does work after the translation into python .
# The decreased number is added to the stack after each loop instead of being multiplied.
# 2nd Lbl 1
# RCL 0 X
# 2nd Dsz   # Decrease the number and test ?
# GTO 1     # If not zero, go back to the begining
# 1 =       # If not zero, finish multiplication
