# Area and circumference of a circle

# Calculate the circumference: 2π x radius.
# Calculate the area: π x radius².
# Note that the pause is simulated by storing the circumference in a register.
# For example, we'll have a circumference of 31.42 and an area of 78.54 for a diameter of 10.

# Input
10 # Enter the diameter

# Main program
2nd Fix 2
/ 2 =               # Radius = diameter / 2πr
STO 1
X 2 X 2nd pi =      # Circumference = 2π x radius
2nd Pause           # Store the circumference in a register
RCL 1 x2 X 2nd pi = # Area = π x radius²
