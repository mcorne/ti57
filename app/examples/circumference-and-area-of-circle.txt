# Circumference and area of a circle

# What is the circumference and the area of a circle for a given the diameter?
# For example, we'll have a circumference of 31.42 and an area of 78.54 for a diameter of 10.
# Note that the pause is simulated by storing the circumference in a register.

# Input
10                  # Diameter

# Main program
2nd Fix 2
/ 2 =               # Radius = diameter / 2
STO 1
X 2 X 2nd pi =      # Circumference = 2π x radius
2nd Pause           # Store the circumference in a register
RCL 1 x2 X 2nd pi = # Area = π x radius²
