- allow array of code lines in token.php, and remove unnecessary actions
- use generic token as keys, eg "exp" instead of "INV 2nd ln" so it can be mapped easily for other calculators
- handle memory as a pattern to capture any number, eg "STO [0-7]"
- shift statements group to the right 4 spaces
- use "statement" instead of "code_line", "group" instead of "code_lines", "script" instead of "code"
- add a covariance token, covariance = q = (sum(X*Y) - sum(X) * sum(Y) / n) / n
  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Covariance
- allow to enter digits and period, eg 0.123= in prog mode
- handle GTO, RST properly etc... as they that have different behaviour in calc or prog mode
